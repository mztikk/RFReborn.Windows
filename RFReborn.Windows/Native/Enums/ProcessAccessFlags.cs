    ///     When a user logs in, the system collects a set of data that uniquely identifies the user during the authentication
    ///     process, and stores it in an access token. This access token describes the security context of all processes
    ///     associated with the user. The security context of a process is the set of credentials given to the process or the
    ///     user account that created the process.
    ///     You can use a token to specify the current security context for a process using the CreateProcessWithTokenW
    ///     function. You can specify a security descriptor for a process when you call the CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser,
    ///     or CreateProcessWithLogonW function. If you specify NULL, the process gets a default security descriptor. The ACLs
    ///     in the default security descriptor for a process come from the primary or impersonation token of the creator.
    ///     To retrieve a process's security descriptor, call the GetSecurityInfo function. To change a process's security
    ///     descriptor, call the SetSecurityInfo function.
